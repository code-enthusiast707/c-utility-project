# c-utility-project
I am starting to develop a project in C.
I haven't decided yet what the project will actually be.

I am maintaining a list of feature here, where i will keep on adding new functions as i implement them :
1. Write to and read from a text file character by character ( removed )
2. Write to and read from a text file line by line ( added in place of 1st feature )
3. Write to and read from a binary file
4. C makefile to automate compile and link process
